# spotify-playlist-randomizer
A simple tool to randomize the song order of your spotify playlist.

## How to use

Run the program and when asked enter the link to you playlist. After the program finishes open the newly generated shuffled.txt file and copy all of its content.
Finally paste the copied content into you new spotify playlist.

## Problems

The program seems to only allow playlists with up to 100 songs.
