# spotify-playlist-randomizer
A simple tool to randomize the song order of your spotify playlist.

## How to use

Run the program and enter the link to your playlist when prompted. After the program finishes, open the newly created shuffled.txt file and copy the entire contents.
Finally, paste the copied content into your new Spotify playlist.

## Problems

The program seems to only allow playlists with up to 100 tracks.
